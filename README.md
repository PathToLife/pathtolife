### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm PathToLife, a Software Engineer / Computer Scientist, more the former.

Here are my projects (at least public ones) and OpenSource Projects where I'm a code contributor across Full Stack, Data Science, Native Applications, and IoT Devices. I tinker with new tech all the time!

I also love travelling, hiking, and space!

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on... a project that we might release after :)

Simple code is friendly to everyone, picking a well trodden path.. most of the time :)
